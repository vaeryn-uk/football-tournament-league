# Football Tournament League

A practice project, using Python & Django.

## Make

Developed with `Make v4.2.1` and `Bash v5.0.17`.

Optional: review `.env`
```
make .env
```
Then review the autogenerated environment, and change for your needs.

To bring up the web app (`.env` above will be autogenerated if you skipped that step),
```
make up
```

And to create an admin user.
```
make adminuser
```
This will use the credentials defined in `.env`.
